Create Zip files from Git repos automatically.

Install SwiftShell locally on your Mac OS X (Yosemite)

https://github.com/kareman/SwiftShell

(See INSTALL section as to how to install it.)

Set PATH to it. (I'm a ZSH user.)

```
path=(/usr/local/SwiftShell/Misc  $path)
```

Run the swift script from your shell.

```
% swiftshell main.swift
```
