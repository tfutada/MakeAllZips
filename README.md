# MakeAllZips
Create Zip files from Git repos automatically.

Install SwiftShell locally on your Mac OS X (Yosemite)
https://github.com/kareman/SwiftShell (See INSTALL section)

Set PATH to it. (I'm a ZSH user.)

```
path=(/usr/local/SwiftShell/Misc  $path)
```

Run the swift script form your shell.

```
% swiftshell main.swift
```
